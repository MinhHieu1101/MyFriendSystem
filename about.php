				<li>The tasks I have not attempted or not completed:
					<ul>
						<li> I'm not sure if I've done everything perfectly, 
						but I've certainly tried my best to complete all of the tasks for this assignment.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Special features I have done, or attempted, 
				in creating the site that should be known about:
					<ul>
						<li>Because I wanted to concentrate on the core functionality, 
						I chose not to implement any special features in this assignment. 
						I believed it was crucial to make sure the fundamental elements functioned properly
						before beginning to add in other features.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The parts I had trouble with:
					<ul>
						<li>I would say that dealing with MySQL queries was one of the most challenging tasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The things I want to do better next time:
					<ul>
						<li>I want to write cleaner code in PHP and HTML, especially when mixing PHP into HTML.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The additional features I added to the assignment:
					<ul>
						<li>If I had more time, I could plan to come up with a new feature. 
						However, I wanted to make sure that I completed all of the required tasks first including the extra challenges, 
						and I nearly ran out of time.</li>
					</ul>
